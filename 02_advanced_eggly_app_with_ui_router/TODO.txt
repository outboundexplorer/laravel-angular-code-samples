1) Implement a real server (including database, login and JWT authentication)
2) Remove dependency jQUERY by implementing ui-bootstrap
3) Modify menu structure to make sure that all main features are flat. i.e. categories and bookmarks
4) Devise a file naming and module naming system
5) Work out how to show active state for categories and bookmarks
6) Refactor removing anonymous functions from controller callbacks
7) Wrap all javascript in IIFE function (function(){ my-code })()
8) As we are using promises, need to implement a way of dealing with promises if they have failed (refer to egghead notes)
9) Server Side, create proper files and classes, don't just do everything within routes.php
